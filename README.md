VBO: {
VBO Var(Unsigned int) -> generate buffer then link towards VBO address 
-> bind VBO to the target array vertex to make it ready to send towards the gpu 
-> Send the data with arguments such as the target buffer,
size in bytes of the vertices data, the vertice array itself,
and the usage of the VBO.
